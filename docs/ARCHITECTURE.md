## VISION.md

### Product Name
**EventStormer** (working title)

### Purpose
EventStormer is an **open-source, purpose-built facilitation tool for Big Picture EventStorming**. It enables teams to visualize, discuss, and understand complex socio-technical systems through collaborative modeling.

Where Miro and other whiteboard tools provide general-purpose canvases, EventStormer embodies the semantics and flow of EventStorming itself — using the right visual grammar, interaction rhythm, and facilitation flow to help teams focus on insight, not tool mechanics.

### Target Audience
- **Facilitators** of Domain-Driven Design and collaborative modeling workshops.
- **Teams** exploring or mapping large-scale business processes (value streams, organizational domains).
- **Consultants and coaches** introducing EventStorming to organizations.

### Core Value
EventStormer exists to:
- **Make EventStorming accessible** to any facilitator or team, without licensing barriers.
- **Preserve the natural flow** of live workshops, even in remote or hybrid settings.
- **Visualize the big picture** of business processes, enabling cross-silo understanding.

### Guiding UX Principles
- **Intuitive**: minimal learning curve; immediate usability.
- **Expressive**: visual language directly represents EventStorming concepts.
- **Lightweight**: no ceremony; frictionless creation.
- **Professional**: refined aesthetic suitable for executive facilitation.
- **Clarity over decoration**: visual meaning takes precedence over embellishment.

### Aesthetic and Tone
- Neutral white/gray palette with muted accent hues.
- Rounded corners, soft shadows, balanced spacing.
- Typography: system sans-serif (Inter / SF Pro) with restrained use of weight.
- Consistent lucide-react icons.
- Smooth, subtle animations (Framer Motion).

### Positioning
An **open, local-first, collaborative model visualization app** for Big Picture EventStorming.  
Future milestones expand to Process and Design levels, with optional AI-assisted semantic helpers.

### Outstanding Questions
- Should the project tagline emphasize *collaborative discovery* or *domain understanding*?
- Should EventStormer visually reference orange stickies as part of branding (e.g., app icon)?

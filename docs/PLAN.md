### Milestone 1 — MVP (Big Picture Only)
**Goal:** Enable full EventStorming workshop flow for remote teams.

#### Core Deliverables
- Infinite canvas with zoom/pan.
- Real-time collaboration layer.
- Palette system (guided facilitation).
- Event/Hotspot/Actor/System/Opportunity/Glossary stickies.
- Vertical & horizontal lines.
- Pivotal event snapping.
- Zone selection and participant assignment.
- Undo/redo and autosave.
- Basic export/import (JSON).
- Light/dark mode.

#### UX
- Clean, Linear-inspired interface.
- System sans fonts, minimal chrome.
- Subtle animations via Framer Motion.
- Clutter-free guided phase indicators.

### Milestone 2 — Local Persistence + Structure Tools
- IndexedDB persistence.
- Checkpoints (snapshot and rollback).
- Theme extraction (group selection → new sub-board).
- Font themes and facilitator control.
- Glossary term highlighting.

---

### Milestone 3 — Collaboration Enhancements
- Breakout group balancing view.
- Participant expertise tagging.
- Facilitator dashboard.
- Export to image/PDF.

---

### Milestone 4 — Process-Level and Design-Level Support
- Introduce Commands and Policies.
- Add process swimlane semantics.
- Expand validation to new element types.

---

### Milestone 5 — AI Assistance & Automation
- Glossary generation from acronyms.
- Past-tense correction suggestions.
- Hotspot clustering and theme suggestions.
- SLA/KPI auto-tagging prototype.

---

### Future (Post-MVP) Considerations
- Integration with Figma, CSV import.
- Optional cloud sync for Open Host model.
- Sandbox mode (unguided).
- Versioned workshop history timeline.

### Outstanding Questions
- Should facilitator settings (palette control, font theme, color scheme) persist globally or per board?
- Should Open Host deployment include a minimal cloud relay service?
